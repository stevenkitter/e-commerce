00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,150
<v ->Hello, and welcome to the complete JavaScript course.</v>

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,950
I'm really excited to have you in this massive course.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,070
And I promise, you made the right choice

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,755
by joining me in this adventure.

5
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:14,263
Because today, JavaScript is not only

6
00:00:14,263 --> 00:00:17,690
the most popular programming language in the world,

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:21,530
but it also powers the entire modern internet.

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,438
Now without further ado, I wanna give you a quick overview

9
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:26,405
of how this course is organized,

10
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:28,707
the projects that we're gonna code together,

11
00:00:28,707 --> 00:00:32,310
and also, what exactly you're gonna learn in this course.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,969
So, the course contains a total of eight sections

13
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,900
with over 26 hours of content.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,860
So we're gonna kick off the course in section two

15
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:44,320
with the very basics of the JavaScript language,

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,430
and programming in general, to give you a solid foundation

17
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,540
for the rest of the course.

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,910
After that, we're gonna take a look behind the scenes

19
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,530
of JavaScript and learn how the language actually works.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,960
And this is gonna be a good mix

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,367
of theory and practical lectures,

22
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,530
designed to give you the knowledge

23
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,290
that many other JavaScript beginners simply don't have.

24
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,069
We then move on to our first project,

25
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,875
where we use JavaScript in the browser

26
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,020
for the very first time.

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,903
And so we're gonna code up this really cool game

28
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:14,440
where we make JavaScript actually interact

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,890
with an HTML webpage.

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,550
Alright, and after that, we're gonna take a deep dive

31
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,190
into the most advanced JavaScript concepts,

32
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,008
and that's objects and functions.

33
00:01:24,008 --> 00:01:27,330
We're gonna talk about things like prototypal inheritance,

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,931
first-class functions, closures, and a lot more stuff.

35
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:33,300
Next up, we put everything we learned

36
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,488
up until this point together,

37
00:01:34,488 --> 00:01:36,780
and code this beautiful budget app,

38
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,090
where you can track incomes and expenses

39
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,012
and calculate the global budget for any given month.

40
00:01:42,012 --> 00:01:45,190
So in this project, you're gonna learn tons of new stuff

41
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,430
like how to structure and organize your code

42
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,980
and how to actually think about problems and solutions.

43
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,246
Then, starting from section number seven,

44
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,560
we're gonna start using next generation JavaScript.

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,750
So ES6, ES7, and even some ES8 features.

46
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,016
So we're gonna start by looking at what's new in ES6,

47
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:08,016
or ES2015, and then code some examples with the new syntax.

48
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,930
Next up, you're gonna learn

49
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,960
all about asynchronous JavaScript, which is used for things

50
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,320
like loading data from external servers with AJAX.

51
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,195
And then finally, to wrap up the course,

52
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:20,110
this is the biggest project,

53
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,940
coded entirely in ES6, ES7, and even ES8.

54
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,520
So we're fetching data from a real API here

55
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,567
and building this real-world app around it

56
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,860
using the latest technologies,

57
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,860
and also tools like NPM, Babel, and Webpack.

58
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,250
Now, in all of the videos, I always explain

59
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,110
every single detail of the JavaScript language

60
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,630
or of the technique that I'm using.

61
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,270
But sometimes, you may still have a question

62
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,070
about one of the topics that you're learning

63
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,080
in a particular video, or maybe you just run into a problem

64
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,490
with your code and need help fixing it.

65
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,688
Well, either way, you can always get help here

66
00:02:55,688 --> 00:02:58,240
in the Udemy Q and A section.

67
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,941
So, at the bottom of the video that you're watching,

68
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:03,580
you will always find the questions section

69
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,650
for that specific video.

70
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,025
So whenever you have a question,

71
00:03:07,025 --> 00:03:08,960
you can check if another student

72
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,470
has already asked the same question before,

73
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,570
and if not, well, you can just post your own.

74
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,630
And you will then get friendly and fast support

75
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,360
from me or from my team

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,460
so that you're back to writing code as fast as possible.

77
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,810
So I hope you're gonna have a ton of fun with the course,

78
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,570
that you become a real advanced JavaScript developer,

79
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,270
and that you will take your web development career

80
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,451
to the next level.

81
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:33,690
That's really all I want to achieve with this course.

82
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,290
And with that being said, let's finally get started.
